  doc: "## TMF API Reference :\ TMF 641 -\ Service Ordering Management\n\n Version 4.0 - Sprint S1 2020\n\nThe Service Order API provides a standardized mechanism for managing Service Order, a type of order which can be used to place an order between a customer and a service provider or between a service provider and a partner and vice versa.\n\n### Service Order resource\nA service order will describe a list of service order items.  A service order item references an action on an existing  or  future  service.  By  service  we  designed  Customer Facing  Service  (CFS)  as  well  as  Resource Facing Service (RFS).\nFrom a component perspective, a service order should be available\n-\ from a Service Orchestration Component (and it could mix CFS and RFS)\n-\ from an Infrastructure Control & Management component (and it would have only RFS)\n\n### Service Order API performs the following operations on service order :\n-\ Retrieval of a service order or a collection of service orders depending on filter criteria\n-\ Partial update of a service order (including updating rules)\n-\ Creation of a service order (including default values and creation rules)\n-\ Deletion of service order (for administration purposes)\n-\ Notification of events on Service ordern\n\n**cancelserviceOrder resource**\nThis resource is used to request a service order cancellation.\n\n**service Order API performs the following operations on cancel service order :**\n\n   -Retrieval of a cancel service order or a collection of cancel service orders \n   -Creation of a cancel service order \n   -Notification of events on cancel service order.\n\nCopyright Â© TM Forum 2019.
